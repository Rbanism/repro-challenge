# The Reproducibility Challenge for Researchers of the Built Environment

**We invite individuals or teams to submit entries with their own reproducible urbanism-related research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved.** 

## Introduction
We know how challenging it can be for urbanism researchers to make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data. The Reproducibility Challenge for Urbanism Researchers is meant both as a learning experience and as an encouragement for urbanism researchers to make their ongoing work reproducible.

The Challenge is organised by TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, in collaboration with the TU Delft Library, and it is part of the Netherlands eScience Center fellowship project [Rbanism](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/claudiu-forgaci/), targeting digital competence in the urbanism research community.

Join the Challenge to learn more about reproducibility while working on your own project!

## Eligibility
The challenge is open internationally to anyone conducting research in an urbanism-related field, such as (but not strictly limited to) urban design, spatial planning, urban studies, landscape architecture, architecture.

## Prizes
Submissions will be ranked based on the level of reproducibility and self-assessement and the top three will be awarded with the following prizes. As we want to support further development in reproducibility practices, we allocate more mentoring hours for the 2nd and 3rd prize winners.

- 1st Prize: ~~€300~~ €500 + 2 mentoring hours
- 2nd Prize: ~~€200~~ €300 + 4 mentoring hours
- 3rd Prize: ~~€100~~ €200 + 6 mentoring hours

### Timeline
- Announcement of the challenge: **Tuesday, 26 October 2022**
- Challenge closes: ~~**Friday, 25 November**~~ **Thursday, 26 January 2023**
- Closing event and winners announced: ~~**Friday, 2 December 2022**~~ TBD (Registration information will follow later)

### Rules
- Submissions can be done individually or in teams. All members of the submission team have to be authors of the submitted material.
- Both published and unpublished research projects are eligible. We especially encourage submissions of unpublished work (e.g., PhD chapters or conference papers that are work in progress) because the Challenge is intended as a process of learning and feedback leading to improvements in the submitted work.
- Submissions are possible for projects with workflows that can be (or should be possible to be) digitally reproduced.

### Resources
If you want to learn more about reproducibility while preparing your submission, check out the [Rbanism resources page](https://rbanism.github.io/Rbanism/resources.html).

### Assessment
A two-tiered assessment process will be used to evaluate and rank the submissions:

1. a peer assessment in which participants evaluate the self-assessment checklist and reproducibility statement of two other submissions;
2. after the entries have been ranked based on peer and self-assessment, the top 10 entries will be evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in the wrap-up event with vouchers and mentoring hours.

## How to submit

1. Make a new GitHub repository and add your project to it.
    
    - If your project is already in a GitHub repository, you do not have to create a new one. 
    - First time using GitHub? Follow the [instructions on how to make a GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

2. Make an issue in the submission repository in which you link to your project and fill out the checklist in the issue template. [Start and issue with the submission template.](https://github.com/Rbanism/repro-challenge/issues/new/choose)

3. If you want to keep your project private, invite @cforgaci as collaborator on your GitHub repo.

    - First time collaborating on GitHub? [Instructions on how to invite a collaborator on a GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

Please note that your issue will always be publicly visible as part of this repository. If your project repository is private, this will only be visible to invited collaborators.
